* Introduction
  This document serves as guideline for creating a new
  experiment from conception to deployment.

* Process Flow
  The following steps must be adhered to when taking up the
  task of developing a new experiment in phase III of
  Virtual Labs. 

** Request for repository creation
   Every experiment under phase III will be version
   controlled and therefore a git repository is the starting
   point.  To get a git repository, create an issue at
   [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/engineers-forum/issues][engineers-forum]] requesting for creation of a repository.
   Apply the label =create-repo-for-experiment=.  Please
   refer to a sample [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/engineers-forum/issues/461][issue]].  The same issue requesting for
   repository is updated after creation of the repository by
   the central platform team.
